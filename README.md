# STM32_GPIO
The previous version of my GPIO base class had a different approach of interrupt handling and configurating the GPIO itself.
The GPIO class had a static list containing the event callback for each GPIO.

Init was an "empty" function because the GPIO initalization is done by MX_GPIO_Init function which is generated by CubeMX during project configuration.

This new GPIO base class (v2.0) has no callback tracking so you need to handle them in the global interrupt routine (lot's of extra code without almost any benefits in verious verison)

but you can define as many GPIO child class with preconfigured GPIO settings as you want so you no need to use anymore CubeMX for GPIO configuration for you own GPIOs.

Then init function calls the HAL_GPIO_Init(_Port, &_GPIOx); with PORT and other necessary parameteres defined in constructor.
